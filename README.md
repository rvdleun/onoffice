####N ote: I am taking an indefinite break on this project as I'm shifting my focus to https://virtc.app.

# On/Office

![](https://onoffice.app/assets/image/github.gif)

On/Office was created to give you some distraction-free privacy during your work. Making use of powerful Virtual Reality and Web technologies, this application offers you a customisable, virtual room where the screen from your computer is streamed in front of you. Fetch a comfy seat, wear your headset and get ready to work distraction-free.

## Features

üè¢ Carry a virtual office with you anywhere.

üåç Change your environment to anything you'd like with a Panoramic image.

üîó Powered by web technology. Runs on any headset supporting WebVR.

üñ±Ô∏è A handy virtual cursor to keep your mouse position on the virtual screen synced at all times

üíª Available for Windows and Mac. Linux version pending.

üòé Fully open-source. Read the [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) file for more background on how the code is structured and how you can get involved.

## Supported headsets

* HTC Vive
* Windows MR
* Oculus Quest
* Oculus Go
* Samsung Gear VR
* Google Daydream
* Google Cardboard (Android & iOS)

(but technically, any headset with support for WebVR will work)

## Roadmap

* Provide separate instructions per supported headset ([*](https://github.com/rvdleun/onoffice/issues/2))
* Add support for environments built in AFrame ([*](https://github.com/rvdleun/onoffice/issues/6))
* Place applications as separate windows in the virtual environments ([*](https://github.com/rvdleun/onoffice/issues/13))

These issues are sorted in random order. Each item has an entry on the [issues page](https://github.com/rvdleun/onoffice/issues). You can find the current progress there. Feel free to contribute in any way possible. Anything is welcome: Feedback, thoughts on priority, implementations, ideas for new features, etc.
